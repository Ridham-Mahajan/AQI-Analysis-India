# Indian Air Pollution Analysis (2015–2020)

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of air pollution trends across major Indian cities from **2015 to 2020**, focusing on key pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and AQI**. The objective is to identify patterns, understand correlations, and highlight pollution hotspots based on real-world air quality data.

## 🔍 Summary of Observations

### 🔹 Major Findings

- **Delhi** recorded the highest average levels of **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO₂**, and **AQI**.
- **Talcher** (Odisha) ranked high in **SO₂** and **CO** due to **coal mining** and **thermal power plants**.
- **Correlation** observed between **PM2.5 and PM10**, suggesting shared sources like vehicular traffic, construction, and industry.
- **AQI** spikes align with elevated **PM2.5** levels, particularly during **winter months** and post **Diwali**.
- **Seasonal variation** is clear, with worst air quality recorded from **October to January**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- **Delhi** is the most polluted city based on long-term averages of several pollutants.
- **Talcher** is another critical hotspot driven by **industrial emissions**.
- **Health Impact**: High AQI levels pose **severe health risks**, especially to children and the elderly.
- **Policy Implication**: Findings emphasize the need for:
  - Clean energy transitions
  - Real-time air monitoring
  - Public awareness campaigns
  - Targeted emission control policies

> _This analysis serves as a foundational study for urban air quality monitoring and policy-making in India._
